# Writing Blog Posts for Sirv

Our blog is located at [sirv.com/blog](https://sirv.com/blog)

## Basics

We should generally publish:

* Feature, release, and integration announcements
* Sirv user case studies
* Tips and tricks
* Examples of how we use Sirv’s features ourselves

We publish blog posts that explain the “why” behind the work we do at Sirv. We want to show people that we're an industry leader with the best products, and we use our blog to tell the stories behind those products.

## Guidelines

When writing for the blog, follow the style points outlined in the [Voice and tone](https://github.com/sirv/styleguides/tree/main/content/voice-and-tone.html) and [Grammar and mechanics](https://github.com/sirv/styleguides/tree/main/content/grammar.html) sections. Here are some more general pointers, too.

### Be casual, but smart :sunglasses:
This isn’t a term paper, so there’s no need to be stuffy. Drop some knowledge while casually engaging your readers with conversational language.

### Be specific
If you're writing about data, put the numbers in context. If you're writing about a Sirv user, give the reader plenty of information about the company's stage, workflow, results, and values.

### Get to the point
Get to the important stuff right away, and don’t bury the kicker. Blog posts should be scannable and easy to digest. Break up your paragraphs into short chunks of three or four sentences, and use subheads. Our users are busy, and we should always keep that in mind.

### Link it up
Feel free to link away from Sirv if it helps you explain something.

### Make 'em LOL :laughing:
Sirv is a fun company, and we want our blog to reflect this. Feel free to throw in a joke here and there, or link out to a funny GIF or YouTube video when appropriate. Just don't overdo it.

### Use pictures and Sirv media
Include images in your blog posts when it makes sense. If you’re explaining how to use Sirv, include screenshots to illustrate your point. Make sure to use alt text. Be sure to use Sirv media when appropriate. A juicy 360 spin can WOW the reader.

### Utilize modern technology
Any technology that helps improve the UX and stand out is fair game: image comparison sliders, [chat bots with dynamic content](https://sirv.com/blog/image-personalization-examples/), D3.js visualizations, interactive demos.

# Grammar, Mechanics, and Word List

Good grammar won't fix crummy writing, but it will help your ideas shine. At Sirv, we write to teach, inform, and empower our users. Grammar helps us accomplish those goals in the most efficient and clear way possible.

The house rules covered here apply to all public-facing content we make. These aren't rules for the sake of rules—the guidelines in this section give you the tools to write consistent content that helps our users.

## Mechanics and Style

### Abbreviations and acronyms

Avoid abbreviations and acronyms where you can. They confuse readers and make people stop and think before they continue reading. At worst, your reader won't understand the acronym you're using, and they'll need to go look it up.

If you want to use an acronym, define it first and establish the acronym. Then you can use the acronym in subsequent mentions.

> Galactic Donuts runs all purchases through a point of sale (or POS) system.

If the acronym is more widely used than the full version, use the acronym instead and don't worry about spelling the full version out. For example:

- CEO, CFO, CTO
- RSS, API, HTML, CSS
- NASA, FBI, CIA
- Scuba

When "a" or "an" precedes an abbreviation or acronym, choose which one based on the *sound* of the abbreviation, not the first letter of the abbreviation.

- An FBI agent, *eff-bee-eye*
- A UFO flew by, *yoo-eff-oh*

### Capitalization

In text, capitalize the first word of every sentence, unless it's camel case (like eBay). For headlines, use title case on H1s and H2s, and sentence case beyond that.

Capitalize proper nouns, like someone's name or a business name.

Never capitalize website names or email addresses.

### Contractions

Use 'em. They help your writing sound friendly and more natural. If you're inclined to use a contraction like "we're" instead of "we are" when you read a sentence out loud, use it in your writing, too.

Use an apostrophe to represent the letters we're removing from the contraction.

- Isn't, the "o" in "is not" is replaced by an apostrophe
- Y'all, the "ou" in "you all" is replaced by an apostrophe
- Cookies 'n' cream, the "a" and "d" in "Cookies and cream" are both replaced by apostrophes

### Dates and times

Spell out the day of the week and the month. Use a numeral for the day of the month. Don't add rd, th, or st to the end of your numeral.

Only include the year when it's necessary to frame a story or when the date is more than 6 months in the future.

- On Thursday, August 10, we're hosting a webinar.
- Her birthday is June 25.
- We're organizing a meetup on Tuesday, July 16, 2019, for automation lovers.

Abbreviate when there are space constraints:

- Fri., Oct. 13
- Aug. 5, 2018

Don't abbreviate March, April, May, June, or July. They're short enough already.

Abbreviate decades within the last 100 years:

- In the '90s
- In the 1870s

Replace numbers you remove with an apostrophe. For '80s, the "19" in "1980s" is replaced by an apostrophe.

### Headlines

**For headline levels one and two** (H1 and H2) we follow general title case guidelines:

- Capitalize the first and last word of a headline
- Capitalize
    - adjectives (orange, helpful)
    - adverbs (quickly, easily)
    - nouns (dog, truck)
    - pronouns (she, our, themselves)
    - verbs (run, connect—don't forget helping verbs like is, have, and are)
    - subordinate conjunctions (once, as, if, when they connect unequal parts of a sentence)
    - prepositions with five letters or more (through, without, above)
- Lowercase
    + articles (a, this, the, that)
    + coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or)
    + prepositions with fewer than five letters (from, over, with) but not through or without)
    + the "to" in an infinitive (For example, "How to Play Guitar")
- Capitalize the first word after a colon, no matter what
- Use numerals like 25, 6, and 4 for all numbers; never write them out
- Use single quotes for any quoted piece of text

When in doubt, use [this capitalization tool](https://headlinecapitalization.com/) to get a properly formatted version of your title.

**For headline levels three and beyond** (H3, H4, H5) we follow sentence case rules:

- Capitalize the first word of the headline
- Capitalize the first word word after a colon, no matter what
- Capitalize titles and proper nouns

### Jargon and industry phrases

Know your audience. Avoid any words, phrases, or inside-jokes that they won't catch onto immediately.

Clear writing relies on simple words, so exclude jargon when you can. If you need to include a term or concept, make sure to define it for the reader.

> "Veronica uses SQL—a programming language that helps you grab info from a database—to create colorful charts and graphs for the marketing team at Costello Industries."

### Job titles and formal titles

Lowercase occupational job titles, no matter where the title is placed in relation to the name.

> Kim Kadiyala, a marketer at Sirv, talked to astronaut Jeanette Epps about NASA's upcoming mission to Mercury.

Other examples:

- graphic designer Adam Kaplan
- pharmacist Erin Kelley
- lead engineer Bryan Helmig

Capitalize common job titles that are acronyms, like CEO.

Capitalize formal titles—a title that someone was elected to, appointed to, or born into—when they appear directly before someone's name:

- Sir Paul McCartney
- General Grievous
- President Selina Meyer

However, lowercase formal titles if they appear after the person's name:

- Daenerys Targaryen, princess of Dragonstone
- Anthony Garcia, mayor of Gotham

When in doubt, just move the title after the name and lowercase it.

### Names

Use a person's full name when you introduce them in your writing. After the first mention, use the person's first name only.

> Dev Shah didn't set out to change the cupcake industry. "When someone told me 'Clash of the Cupcakes' was affecting global frosting markets, I was floored," he says. As the longtime host of the world's most popular baking show, Dev has launched countless cupcake careers.

If you're writing about multiple subjects with the same first name use the first initial of their last name to avoid confusion.

### Numbers

Always use numerals in the following situations:

- Addresses. "102 Pike St., Seattle, Washington 98101"
- Ages. "George Washington died at age 67.""
- Big numbers. "3 billion", not "three billion" or "3,000,000,000"
- Dates. "March 15", not "March fifteenth". "The '90s", not "the nineties"
- Money. "$9.75", not "nine dollars and 75 cents"
- Percentages. "80%" not "eighty percent"
- Times. "5 p.m." and "6:30 a.m.", not "5 o'clock" or "six thirty".
  - *Exception: use "noon" and "midnight" instead of "12 p.m." and "12 a.m.", respectively.*

Otherwise, write out numbers when they're less than 10.

> Wade ate three pints of cookies 'n' cream ice cream.
> Chelsea created 12 Spins in under an hour.

Numbers longer than three digits get commas:

- 591
- 1,839
- 525,600

### Punctuation

#### Apostrophes

Most of the time you'll use an apostrophe to demonstrate possession or to build a contraction.

Use an apostrophe to show a noun's possession of something:

- Jill's team is working on that project.
- Apple's new iPhone leaked last night.
- He raves about Julius's design skills.

If the noun ends in an "s", add an apostrophe and an s—like "Marcus's"—to the end of the noun to demonstrate possession.

For contractions, use an apostrophe in place of the letters you've left out. Read the [contractions section](#contractions) for more details.

Use an apostrophe to make a letter plural, but not a number.

- I got mostly A's and B's in high school.
- The judges gave her performance 10s across the board.

#### Commas

Use the Oxford comma (also called the serial comma). In lists of three or more items, always include a comma before the last item.

> You can use Sirv with WordPress, Shopify and PrestaShop.




#### Semicolons

Try to avoid semicolons. They tend to be difficult to use well, and bring a more formal tone to your writing.

Write around them using dashes, commas, and coordinating conjunctions instead.

> He promised to send me the details today — and a summary showed up in my inbox at 5 p.m.

Not

> He promised to send me the details today; they showed up in my inbox at 5 p.m.

Do use semicolons, though, to clarify a complex list of comma-separated items. For example:

> For Elise, Rob, and Melanie, Trello fit perfectly; it gave them task-tracking, color-coded labels, and the ability to assign Cards to the right person.

Use semicolons sparingly. Try to edit around them. When they're necessary, use semicolons as a more powerful version of a comma, which separates two related thoughts.

#### Quotation marks

### Quoting people and publications

When you're quoting a person or publication in a piece of content, make sure that quote is accurately attributed. Use present tense (says, not said):

> "I love using Sirv to showcase my products," Jimmy says.

Try to introduce the quoted person before you quote them. This:

> Selena, a manager at Galactic Donuts, uses Sirv to manage her images. "It makes my life so much easier," she says.

Is preferred to:

> "Sirv makes my life so much easier," Selena, a manager at Galactic Donuts, says.

Keep the focus on the person who said the quote by placing their name directly after it, before "says". Use "he", "she", or "they" when you're quoting the same person in quick succession and it's clear that the quote belongs to the same speaker. If the quotes are close enough, you can leave out the second "says" entirely.

> "'Rumours' is my favorite Fleetwood Mac album," Matt says. The Grammy-winning 1977 record is a staple in any music fan's library. "You can't listen to 'Second Hand News' without singing along."

Accurate quotes are important, but we also want to make our subjects look good. Feel free to edit out the "ums" and "uhs" from a direct quote. It's ok to tweak the grammar in a quote, but use caution not to change the quote's meaning. When in doubt, ask your subject for clarification or approval.

## Writing About Partners and Other Companies

When writing about partners, default to their style. Write Tweet, not tweet. Write Trello card, not Card or to-do. Follow regular capitalization rules at the beginning of sentences.

If you don't know, ask. When in doubt, skew towards understanding. If an app lets you create "things", capitalize Things to let the reader know that this is a specific feature of the app, and to avoid confusion.

## Writing About Sirv

### Sirv-specific words and terms

Like many apps, Sirv has its own lexicon for explaining the product. We try to keep things as simple as possible, but here are some terms that hold special meaning in our app.


#### Sirv JS
This is the backbone of Sirv's viewers. Sirv Spin, Zoom and Responsive imaging rely on it.


#### Sirv Spin

Sirv Spin is a 360 degree product viewer, which looks like this:
<div class="Sirv" data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/Examples/nike/nike.spin"></div>

> "To show your products from every angle, use Sirv Spin. It increases conversions by at least 27% by the way."

*Step Notes*: Spin should always be capitalized. For inexperienced users, we can explain what it is further.

#### Sirv Zoom
Sirv Zoom is a special way to embed Sirv images which looks like this:

```html
<div class="Sirv" data-effect="zoom" >
    <img data-src="https://sirv.sirv.com/Examples/example-shoe3.jpg" />
</div>
```

*Style Notes*: We capitalize Zoom because it's the name of our feature.

Zoom should be capitalized only when referring to the actual product feature. For example, in this sentence, "zoom" should not be capitalized:

> "You can zoom your images by x10 without sacrificing loading speed"


#### Dynamic imaging
Dynamic imaging is a completely alien term to a lot of users. It's easier to break it down into its distinct use cases to explain stuff.

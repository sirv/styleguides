## Branching Strategy

| Branch          | Purpose                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| `master`        | Production-ready code        |
| `dev`           | Integration / staging branch |
| `feature/*`     | Feature branches             |
| `fix/*`         | Fix branches                 |
| `hotfix/*`      | Hotfix branches              |
| `refactoring/*` | Refactoring branches         |

- Always branch off from `dev`.
- Use `<commit-type>/<scope>` naming convention (e.g. `feature/select-account` or `feature/sa-1234`).

---

## Pull Request Titles

Use this format for all PR titles:

```
<type>(<scope>): Short, clear PR title
```

**Examples:**
```
fix(auth): prevent crash on expired token
feat(uikit): add RadioGroup component
refactor(core): simplify size format utility
```

- No Jira ticket numbers in titles.
- Focus on clarity, consistency, and scope.

## Pre-Merge Checklist

Before requesting a review:

- [ ] Pull latest from `dev`
- [ ] Test changes manually
- [ ] Lint and type-check
- [ ] Remove debug logs and unused code
- [ ] Test affected local packages (e.g., `@sirv/ui`)
- [ ] Visually and functionally test any shared components (like from @sirv/ui) across all applications where they're used, to ensure nothing breaks
- [ ] Clearly document any updates to shared packages or workspace configurations

---

## Review Process

- Use `[WIP]` in title if still in progress.
- Assign **at least two reviewers** once ready.
- Be responsive to feedback and update PR as needed.
- Don‚Äôt self-merge unless explicitly allowed (e.g., for solo-owned modules).

---

## Merging Rules

- Merge only into `dev`.
- Use **Squash and merge** to keep commit history clean.
- Ensure:
  - Review approved
  - No conflicts
  - Final tests passed

If a shared package (e.g., `ui`) is changed:
- Note the impact clearly in PR

```

**Example:**

| `test`      | Adding or updating tests                 |
| `docs`      | Documentation only                       |
| `chore`     | Tooling, infra, package updates          |
| `build`     | Build tools and dependency changes       |
| `perf`      | Performance optimizations                |

### Common Scopes

| Scope              | Usage example                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `<module>`         | Module (e.g. `auth`)              |

| `core`             | Utilities and shared logic        |
| `config`           | Tooling, build, or monorepo setup |

### Avoid

- Vague messages (`fix stuff`, `changes`)
- Unscoped or multi-purpose commits
- Leaving debug or test-only commits unsquashed
